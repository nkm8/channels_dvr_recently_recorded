| img_dir         | '/upcoming-media-card-images/recently_recorded/' | no       | This option allows you to choose a custom directory to store images in if you enable download_images. Directory must start and end with a `/`. |

#### By default this addon automatically downloads images from the Channels site to your /www/custom-lovelace/upcoming-media-card/ directory. The directory is automatically created & only images reported in the upcoming list are downloaded. Images are small in size and are removed automatically when no longer needed.
