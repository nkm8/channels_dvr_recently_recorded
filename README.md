- [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/custom-cards/upcoming-media-card/blob/master/troubleshooting.md)
- [@thomasloven's lovelace guide](https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-config/wiki/Lovelace-Plugins).

## Installation:

1. Install this component by copying [these files](https://github.com/rccoleman/channels_dvr_recently_recorded) to `custom_components/channels_dvr_recently_recorded/`.
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. If your Channels DVR installation is discovered via Zeroconf, you will get a notification and will be able to configure the integration without the need to specify the host and port.  Otherwise, add the integration from Configuration->Integrations->Add Integration.  Search for "Channels".
4. Install the card: [Upcoming Media Card](https://github.com/custom-cards/upcoming-media-card)
5. Add the code for the card to your `ui-lovelace.yaml`.

### Options

This integration can only be configuration through the UI (Configuration->Integrations), and the options below can be configured when the integration is added (`host` and `port` aren't needed for a Zeroconf configuration).

| img_dir         | '/upcoming-media-card-images/recently_recorded/' | no       | This option allows you to choose a custom directory to store images in if you enable download_images. Directory must start and end with a `/`. |

#### By default this addon automatically downloads images from the Channels site to your /www/custom-lovelace/upcoming-media-card/ directory. The directory is automatically created & only images reported in the upcoming list are downloaded. Images are small in size and are removed automatically when no longer needed.
